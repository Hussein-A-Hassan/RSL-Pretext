This is the code for the RSL pretext, that is used for self-supervised visual representation learning from videos.
The trained models for the Ablation experiments are available at [RSL-Ablation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_7uOuHol2psBiaaSOuOKKFtReTUg-BCk?usp=drive_link).

Notes:
1- The dataset (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) main folder should have two sub-folders named (Videos, Splits). The Videos sub-folder contains all the videos of the dataset, while the Splits sub-folder contains the files that define the videos for each split.
